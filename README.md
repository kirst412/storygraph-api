# Unofficial StoryGraph API for Python

An unofficial Python wrapper for The StoryGraph API, forked from [ym496/storygraph-api](https://github.com/ym496/storygraph-api).

This fork has been significantly refactored and enhanced to be more efficient, reliable, and feature-rich.

## Key Enhancements in This Fork

* **No More Selenium**: The original dependency on Selenium and a headless browser has been completely removed. This version uses the `requests` library directly for all API communication, resulting in a much lighter, faster, and more stable experience.
* **Expanded API Coverage**: Many new features have been added, including methods to:
  * Fetch your reading progress.
  * Get your read dates for a book.
  * Retrieve all your journal entries or entries for a specific book.
  * Get a book's AI-generated summary.
  * Fetch a user's ID.
* **Modernized Codebase**: The code has been updated with type hints and a more robust project structure.
* **Cookie-Based Authentication**: Authentication is now handled by passing your browser's session cookies, which is a more reliable method than the previous implementation.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

This wrapper requires authentication for most features. You'll need to provide your StoryGraph session cookies and username.

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project.
2. **Find your cookies**:
   * Open your web browser and log in to [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/).
   * Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12).
   * Go to the "Application" (in Chrome) or "Storage" (in Firefox) tab.
   * Under the "Cookies" section for `app.thestorygraph.com`, find the values for `_storygraph_session` and `remember_user_token`.
3. **Add your credentials to the `.env` file**:

   ```dotenv
   _STORYGRAPH_SESSION=your_session_cookie_value
   REMEMBER_USER_TOKEN=your_remember_token_value
   STORYGRAPH_USERNAME=your_storygraph_username
   ```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the `Book` and `User` clients.

```python
import os
import json
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from storygraph_api import Book, User

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# --- Authentication ---
username = os.getenv("STORYGRAPH_USERNAME")
session_cookie = os.getenv("_STORYGRAPH_SESSION")
remember_token = os.getenv("REMEMBER_USER_TOKEN")

auth_cookies = {
    "_storygraph_session": session_cookie,
    "remember_user_token": remember_token
}

# --- Initialize Clients ---
book_client = Book()
user_client = User()

# --- User Client Examples ---

# Get user ID
user_id_json = user_client.get_user_id(username)
user_id = json.loads(user_id_json).get("user_id")
print(f"User ID: {user_id}")

# Get 'Currently Reading' list
currently_reading = user_client.currently_reading(username, auth_cookies)
print(currently_reading)

# Get 'To-Read' list
to_read = user_client.to_read(username, auth_cookies)
print(to_read)

# Get 'Read' list
books_read = user_client.books_read(username, auth_cookies)
print(books_read)

# --- Book Client Examples ---

book_id = "1c023e31-637b-41d9-ba64-260c3c1b0f3d" # Example book ID

# Search for a book
search_results = book_client.search("Dune Frank Herbert")
print(search_results)

# Get book info
book_info = book_client.book_info(book_id)
print(book_info)

# Get your reading progress for a book
progress = book_client.reading_progress(book_id, auth_cookies)
print(progress)

# Get your read dates for a book
read_dates = book_client.get_read_dates(book_id, auth_cookies)
print(read_dates)

# Get your journal entries for a book
journal_entries = book_client.get_journal_entries(book_id, auth_cookies)
print(journal_entries)

# Get the AI summary for a book
if user_id:
    ai_summary = book_client.get_ai_summary(book_id, user_id)
    print(ai_summary)
```
